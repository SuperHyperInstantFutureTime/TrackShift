A music royalties data aggregator
=================================

We make releasing music easier.

We are DIY artists, label people, software developers and music consumers who are building tools to give indies superpowers in the age of big data.

"Giving indies superpowers in the age of big data."

Dev todo
--------

The current SLC-1 release branch is underway. The following top level to-do list will be picked up soon:

- [x] Tidy the `Upload` entity with the introduction of the `User`-driven `UploadManager` class.
- [ ] Process the `Upload` list into their usages, but mark the Upload as processed or not, and retain the link from the `Usage` back to the original `Upload`.
- [ ] Manage the metadata associated with the upload, by creating entities like `Album`, `Artist`, etc. automatically via Spotify API.
