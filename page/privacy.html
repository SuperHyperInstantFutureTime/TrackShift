<h3>Who is Trackshift operated by?</h3>
<p>Trackshift is operated by <strong><a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/14489347" target="_blank">Super Hyper Instant Future Time Ltd.</a></strong>, a UK company formed by <strong>Richard Birkin and Greg Bowler</strong>. Richard is a music composer, Greg is a software engineer, both have interests in music and solving problems.</p>
<p>The purpose of Trackshift is to solve problems in the music industry, but to do this we require users to upload their data to the system. We've purposefully kept things completely simple so we can keep everything as transparent as possible, and we will strictly follow this document throughout the development process.</p>
<p>The product is developed <a href="https://github.com/SuperHyperInstantFutureTime/Trackshift" target="_blank">open source on Github</a>, but your data is closed on a private server.</p>

<h3>Where is data stored?</h3>
<p>Data you upload to Trackshift is stored on a server in <strong>London, UK</strong>.</p>
<p>On the server, the original data files are stored unmodified in an area on an <strong>encrypted disk</strong> that's unique to your user, <strong>identified by a randomised ID</strong> string (seen in the URL).</p>
<p>In a future release, the data that is uploaded to Trackshift will be encrypted at rest, but until this adds value to the product, data files are unmodified after upload.</p>

<h3>How long is data stored?</h3>
<p>Unless we're instructed otherwise, we keep the files you upload on our servers for <strong>3 weeks</strong>.</p>
<p>You can extend the amount of time the data is stored by 3 weeks within the application.</p>
<p>You can <strong>purge your data</strong> at any time within the application. Doing this completely removes any trace of your uploaded files from our system.</p>
<p>There are no backups of data made at this time.</p>

<h3>Use of your data</h3>
<p><strong>The application does not know who you are</strong>, although the contents of the uploaded files could be used to possibly identify someone.</p>
<p>During the product's development, <strong>we may inspect uploaded files</strong> to ensure the operation of the application is working as expected. If you do not want us to see the contents of your files, do not upload them to our server.</p>
<p>After the product is formally released, encryption measures will be put in place to prevent even the application operators from inspecting the contents of uploaded data, but at this point we can see the raw data as it was provided to us.</p>

<h3>Sharing your data</h3>
<p>Data only ever enters Trackshift, and is <strong>never sent anywhere</strong> else.</p>
<p>Once data is removed from the application, it is gone forever.</p>
<p><strong>We will never share anything uploaded to us with anyone, ever</strong>.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A single cookie is used by Trackshift, called a Session Cookie, which is classed as <strong>strictly necessary</strong> for operation of the application. It is stored on Trackshift's domain, and can't be read by any other domains.</p>
<p>A session cookie is not used for tracking, but for linking your browser's session to the correct user data.</p>
<p>We have no interest in advertising or profiling our user's demographics, so we do not set any third party cookies.</p>
