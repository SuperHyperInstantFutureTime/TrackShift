# Why did your upload fail?

<section>

### We're still building TrackShift, and learning all the time about the different formats that sales reports come in. 

### The reason your upload failed is probably one of these...

_- We haven't seen one like it before, so TrackShift doesn't know what it is._

If this is the case, we're happy because we can easily teach TrackShift to process a new type of upload.

_- It's got something in it that causes processing to fail._

Again, we can teach TrackShift what to do if this is what's happening.

_- It's not a file type that we support._

Currently, TrackShift is built to handle sales report files. These normally come in .csv format. TrackShift can't process PDFs, JPGs or anything like that. We'd love to talk to you about what files you have though, so [get in touch](mailto:biff@trackshift.app).
