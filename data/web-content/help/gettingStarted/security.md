## Security

### Storage 

Files uploaded to TrackShift are stored on Digital Ocean where they are encrypted at rest.

### Account

If you are using the Demo version of TrackShift (where you can use the service without registering):

- your anonymous credentials are stored in a browser cookie
- your data is stored on the TrackShift server and in the TrackShift databases anonymously, but still encrypted
- data held against an anonymous ID will be deleted from the servers and databases every 3 months
