## Sales Reports

### What is a Sales Report?

A Sales Report is a file that contains data on your music Earnings.

It usually comes in spreadsheet format like .xls, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv or even .txt

It contains many rows of data showing dates, amounts and sources of earnings for each Artist, Album, Format or Track


### How do I get my Sales Reports?

You should get Sales Reports from your distributor when they send your earnings. 

If not, you should be able to access or export them from your login area on their website. 

Here's a list of all the online platforms we can process the data from, and how to access the files that TrackShift needs:
