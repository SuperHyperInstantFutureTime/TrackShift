# Introduction

## What is TrackShift?

TrackShift is a cloud-based service that helps Record Labels do business better. 

From paying artists faster to getting an up to date picture on profit and loss, TrackShift automatically calculates outgoing royalties from all of your sales channels.

## How does it work?

TrackShift takes the sales reports that come from where your music is sold and combines them into one easy-to-read table. 

From there, it calculates earnings and costs for each album or song and applies your profit share splits so that you know how much to pay your artists, and how much stays with the label.

## Who is it for?

TrackShift is for anyone who sells music and wants to better understand their sales - record labels, DIY artists and bands.
