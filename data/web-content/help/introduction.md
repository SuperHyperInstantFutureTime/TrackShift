## What is TrackShift?

## How does it work?

TrackShift takes the sales reports that come from where your music is sold and combines them into one easy to read table. 

From there, it calculates earnings and costs for each album or song and applies your profit share splits so that you know how much to pay your artists, and how much stays with the label.
