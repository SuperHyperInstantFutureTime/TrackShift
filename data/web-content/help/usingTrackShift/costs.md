## Costs

Costs are expenses that affect a Product's Balance, and whether or not it has 'earned out' into profit.

<aside>
<strong>Example</strong>:<br />
The Label is going to release an album by The Artist on digital and vinyl, with a small PR campaign and some paid advertising on social media.<br />
The Costs for this album, paid for by The Label and recoupable from earnings, could be something like this:

<table>
 <thead>
    <tr>
<td>Cost Item</td>
<td>Amount</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Vinyl Mastering</td><td>£200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vinyl Manufacturing</td><td>£2500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PR Agent</td><td>£2000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ad budget</td><td>£500</td>
</tr>
<tr class="totals">
<td>Total</td><td>£5200</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The above Costs would create a Balance of -£5200 against the album on the Products table.<br />
The album would need to earn more than £5200 before any Outgoing profits will show on the Products table.
