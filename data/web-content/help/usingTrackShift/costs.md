### What are Costs?
Costs are expenses that affect a Product's Balance, and whether or not it has 'earned out' into profit.

<aside>
<strong>Example</strong>:<br />
The Label is going to release an album by The Artist on digital and vinyl, with a small PR campaign and some paid advertising on social media.<br />
The Costs for this album, paid for by The Label and recoupable from earnings, could be something like this:

<table>
 <thead>
    <tr>
<td>Cost Item</td>
<td>Amount</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Vinyl Mastering</td><td>£200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vinyl Manufacturing</td><td>£2500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PR Agent</td><td>£2000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ad budget</td><td>£500</td>
</tr>
<tr class="totals">
<td>Total</td><td>£5200</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The above Costs would create a Balance of -£5200 against the album on the Products table.<br />
The album would need to earn more than £5200 before any Outgoing profits will show on the Products table.
</aside>

### Adding a Cost

1. Click 'Add Cost'
2. Select the Artist from the dropdown
3. Select the Album from the dropdown
4. Enter a description for the Cost e.g. Vinyl Manufacturing
5. Enter an amount
6. Click 'Create'

The Cost will count as a negative on the Balance of a Product. If you view the Product on the Products table, you'll see the Balance has been affected by the Cost you created.

### Finding a Cost

1. Click the Costs tab or go to trackshift.app/account/costs
2. Type in the artist name in the search box or scroll to find the cost.

### Deleting a Cost

1. Scroll to the Cost you want to Delete.
2. Click 'Delete' on the right hand side of the Cost.

The Cost will no longer have any affect on the Balance of a Product.
