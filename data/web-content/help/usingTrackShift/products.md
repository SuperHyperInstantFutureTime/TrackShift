## Products

After TrackShift has successfully imported your Sales Report file, you'll see the Product table.

The table's columns display the following:

### Product

When importing sales reports, TrackShift uses the ISRC and UPC codes to organise all the songs into their respective albums by each Artist.

While we're at it, we also grab the artwork from Spotify (if we can) because we proper love looking at record sleeves and figured you do too.

### Earnings

All of the earnings are added up to show how much each album has earned. This total includes single track streams/sales as well as physical and digital album sales.

### Balance

Every product has a Balance that takes into account money earned and money spent on the release.

Balance = Earnings - Costs

<aside>
<strong>Example:</strong><br />
<i>Earnings</i>: the album has <i>Earnings</i> of £200.<br />
<i>Costs</i>: the album has <i>Costs</i> of £100.<br />
<i><strong>Balance</strong></i>: the <i>Balance</i> of the album is £100 (£200 - £100).<br />
</aside>

See also: Costs.

### Outgoing

A product's profits are shared between parties. E.g. The Label and The Artist. The percentage of profits due to each are set as Splits.

<i>Outgoing</i> is the amount of profit owed to parties who are not the TrackShift user.</aside>

<strong>Example:</strong><br />
<i>Earnings</i>: the album has <i>Earnings</i> of £200.<br />
<i>Costs</i>: the album has <i>Costs</i> of £100.<br />

<i>Splits</i>: The Label has a 50% split of profits. The Artist also has 50%.<br />
<i><strong>Outgoing</strong></i>: The Artist's 50% split is an Outgoing of £100 * 50% = £50.<br />
