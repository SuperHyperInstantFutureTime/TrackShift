## Splits

Splits are how a product's profits are divided.

<aside>
<strong>Example:</strong><br />
The Label is going to release an album by The Artist.<br />
The Artist has paid for the recording.<br />
The Label is going to pay for the release.<br />
Both parties have agreed a 50% profit share split.

When the album has earned enough to be in profit by £100, The Artist will be owed £50, and The Label will keep £50.
