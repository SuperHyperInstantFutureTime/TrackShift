### What are Splits?

Splits are how a product's profits are divided.

<aside>
<strong>Example:</strong><br />
The Label is going to release an album by The Artist.<br />
The Artist has paid for the recording.<br />
The Label is going to pay for the release.<br />
Both parties have agreed a 50% profit share split.

When the album has earned enough to be in profit by £100, The Artist will be owed £50, and The Label will keep £50.

13. Click the '+' button
14. When you've finished assigning splits to an album, click OK
15. You will see the completed Split appear in the list of Splits.

*Split Owner email address will be required soon so that royalty statements can be automatically sent to your Artists.

When you have added a Split for a Product, and if the Product Balance is in profit, you will see that the Outgoing column will show an amount. This amount is the percentage of the positive Balance belonging to Split Owners who are not You. Your Split of the positive Balance is shown in the Profit column.

The Product has earned £1,000,000 with costs of £100,000<br>
The two Writers have Splits totalling 50% (25% each)<br>
The Label has a Split of 50%<br>
