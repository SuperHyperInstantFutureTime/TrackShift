# We make releasing music easier.

## We are DIY artists, label people, software developers and music consumers who are building tools to give indies superpowers in the age of big data.

<!-- why? -->

### Main feature 

Music is a £20 billion global industry run on shared spreadsheets and antiquated systems that takes ages to pay artists (and not always correctly). 

Independent record labels with the most artist-friendly deals often spend a month out of every year sorting through those spreadsheets or grappling with those antiquated systems in order to understand how much their artists have earned. 

We're building an innovative royalties processor to solve that.

### Some detail about our approach to the problem

Close by the ever-burning brimstone beds
Where Bedloe, Oates and Judas, hide their heads,
I saw great Satan like a Sexton stand
With his intolerable spade in hand,
Digging three graves. Of coffin shape they were,
For those who, coffinless, must enter there
With unblest rites. The shrouds were of that cloth
Which Clotho weaveth in her blackest wrath:
The dismal tinct oppress’d the eye, that dwelt
Upon it long, like darkness to be felt.
The pillows to these baleful beds were toads,
Large, living, livid, melancholy loads,
Whose softness shock’d. Worms of all monstrous size
Crawl’d round; and one, upcoil’d, which never dies.
A doleful bell, inculcating despair,
Was always ringing in the heavy air.
And all about the detestable pit
Strange headless ghosts, and quarter’d forms, did flit,
Rivers of blood, from living traitors spilt,
By treachery stung from poverty to guilt.
I ask’d the fiend, for whom these rites were meant?
“These graves,” quoth he, “when life’s brief oil is spent,
When the dark night comes, and they’re sinking bedwards,
—I mean for Castles, Oliver, and Edwards.”
