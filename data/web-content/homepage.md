# We make releasing music easier.

## We are DIY artists, label people, software developers and music consumers who are building tools to give indies superpowers in the age of big data.

<!-- why? -->

### Main feature 

Music is a Â£20 billion global industry run on shared spreadsheets and antiquated systems that takes ages to pay artists (and not always correctly). 

Independent record labels with the most artist-friendly deals often spend a month out of every year sorting through those spreadsheets or grappling with those antiquated systems in order to understand how much their artists have earned. 

We're building an innovative royalties processor to solve that.

### Some detail about our approach to the problem

I ask'd the fiend, for whom these rites were meant? "These graves," quoth he, "when life's brief oil is spent, when the dark night comes, and they're sinking bedwards, I mean for Castles, Oliver, and Edwards."

A fictional account is given of the postwar slump, chartism, the Pentrich Revolution and industrial progress in The Reckoning, Volume 15 of The Morland Dynasty, a series of historical novels by author Cynthia Harrod-Eagles.
