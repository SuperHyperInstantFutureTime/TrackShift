# Simple, loveable admin tools for independent music and publishing people.

## We exist to get artists paid quicker, and to give time back to labels so they can release more amazing music.

<!-- why? -->
<section>

<!-- Music is a Â£20 billion global industry run on shared spreadsheets and antiquated systems that takes ages to pay artists (and not always correctly).  -->

Independent record labels with the most artist-friendly deals are struggling to process the masses of sales data they get every month or quarter. They want to pay their artists, but it's taking them ages to work it all out. 

We're building an innovative sales and royalties processor to solve that.

## About Us

TrackShift was founded by Greg Bowler and Richard 'Biff' Birkin in Derbyshire, UK.  

Greg is a technologist, solving real world problems using software. His work ranges from logging and analysis dashboards for the renewable energy sector, to interfacing with event ticketing systems for attendeees with a disability.   

Biff is a composer and digital strategist/user experience designer - the latter skills developed in startups that gave him the flexi-time needed to carry on being in bands and touring UK/Europe's DIY punk/hardcore scene.

Our working ethic is inspired by that scene, paired with a software development mantra of Simple, Loveable and Complete feature development.

## What We're Doing

We're working with a handful of small independent record labels, learning how they work and what their data looks like. 

TrackShift v1 will be launched for Record Labels early 2024 as part of an Innovate UK funded development sprint through 2023.
